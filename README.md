# StarCraft II Game Assistant

A real-time assistant for StarCraft II using Python and OpenCV. It detects enemy units on the minimap and monitors your supply count, giving timely audio alerts during gameplay.

---

## Features

- üìç Detects new red dots (enemy units) on the minimap
- üîä Plays warning audio when enemy activity is detected
- üì¶ Monitors supply count and alerts when you‚Äôre near supply block

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## üõ† Tech Stack

- Python
- OpenCV
- PyAutoGUI
- Pytesseract
- Pygame

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
## How to Run / Prerequisites

- Python 3.7+
- Tesseract OCR must be installed on your system  
  [Download it here](https://github.com/tesseract-ocr/tesseract)

Update the path in `supply_depot.py` LIKE THIS:
```python
# Inside supply_depot.py
pytesseract.pytesseract.tesseract_cmd = r"C:\Program Files\Tesseract-OCR\tesseract.exe"
```
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Install dependencies with:
MAKE SURE YOU'RE IN THE CORRECT FOLDER BEFORE RUNNING IT

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Starting the Assistant:

Audio Alerts
Two .mp3 files are used to provide audio warnings:

minimap_warning.mp3 ‚Äì Played when new enemy units appear on the minimap

supply_warning.mp3 ‚Äì Played when you're close to being supply blocked

These are already included. You can replace them or generate your own using the scripts in the /tools folder
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Optional: Customize Voice Alerts
Want your own voice lines? Use the Python scripts in the /tools folder:

/tools/generate_supply_voice.py
/tools/generate_minimap_voice.py

I made this project to help my dad improve at StarCraft II ‚Äî specifically to give him an edge in noticing enemy movements and managing his supply more efficiently.
He‚Äôs a solid player, but tends to get caught off guard or supply blocked at key moments. My goal was to give him a tool that boosts his awareness, so maybe (just maybe) he can finally break into Gold rank.

It also gave me a great excuse to explore computer vision, and Python automation in a fun and meaningful way.
