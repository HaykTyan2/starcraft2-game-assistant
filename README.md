I made this project to help my dad improve at StarCraft II â€” specifically to give him an edge in noticing enemy movements and managing his supply more efficiently.
Heâ€™s a solid player, but tends to get caught off guard or supply blocked at key moments. My goal was to give him a tool that boosts his awareness, so maybe (just maybe) he can finally break into Gold rank.

It also gave me a great excuse to explore computer vision, and Python automation in a fun and meaningful way.
